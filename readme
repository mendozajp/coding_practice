Planning on dropping a bunch of different coding snippets here from problems or anything I found interesting. These days I'm doing a lot of leetcode, so I'm dropping that code in here and some notes on my learnings from it. 

Beyond that leaving it open for whatever cool code I write that I wanna save and maybe refer back to someday
